Here is an example of a for loop in Java to iterate over an array of Strings:

```Java
String[] names = { "Sheetal" , "Sunaina" , "Aishwarya" };
for(String name: names){
System.out.println(name);
}
```
The same thing can be done in python
```python
names = [ "Sheetal" , "Sunaina" , "Aishwarya" ]
for name in names:
print(name)

How about in JavaScript

```javascript
names = [ "Sheetal" , "Sunaina" , "Aishwarya" ]
names.forEach((name)=>console.log(name))
```
